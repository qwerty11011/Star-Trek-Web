				<h3>Story</h3>
				<p>Beginning roughly ten years before the events of Star Trek: The Original Series, the show sees the
					united Klingon houses in a war with the United Federation of Planets that involves the crew of the
					USS Discovery.

					<h2><b>Michael Burnham</b></h2>
					<h3>Casting : Sone1ua Martin-Green</h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/MB.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						<dd>A science specialist on USS Discovery. Burnham was First Officer of the USS Shenzhou, where
							she was referred to as "Number One" to to honor the character of the same name portrayed by
							Majel Barrett in the original Star Trek pilot "The Cage". Burnham is a human who was raised
							following Vulcan culture and traditions by Sarek. Unlike the protagonists of previous Star
							Trek series, she was not made a starship captain, in order "to see a character from a
							different perspective on the starship—one who has different dynamic relationships with a
							captain, with subordinates, it gave us richer context". Fuller deliberately gave the
							character a traditionally male name, which he had done with the female leads on three of his
							previous series.</dd>
					</p>

				<hr />
				<header>
					<h2><b>Saru</b></h2>
					<h3>Casting : Doug Jones</h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/SU.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						<dd>First officer of the USS Discovery, Saru was previously science officer of the USS Shenzhou.
							Saru is the first Kelpien to enter Starfleet. Kelpiens, a new species created for Discovery,
							were hunted as prey on their home planet and thus evolved the ability to sense the coming of
							danger, giving them a reputation for cowardice. Jones based Saru's walk on that of a
							supermodel, out of necessity thanks to the boots he had to wear to portray the character's
							hooved feet, forcing Jones to walk on the balls of his feet. The producers compared Saru to
							the characters Spock and Data from previous series.</dd>

					<h2><b>Sylvia Tilly</b></h2>
					<h3>Casting : Mary Wiseman</h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/TI.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						<dd>A cadet in her final year at Starfleet Academy, assigned to the Discovery. She works under
							Stamets aboard the Discovery, where Burnham becomes her roommate. The character was included
							to represent people "at the very bottom of this ladder" of the Starfleet hierarchy. She is
							"the most optimistic ... has the biggest heart", and showrunner Aaron Harberts described her
							as "sort of the soul of our show."</dd>
					</p>

				<hr />
				<header>
					<h2><b>Ash Tyler</b></h2>
					<h3>Casting : Shazad Latif</h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/TY.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						<dd>A Klingon who undergoes surgery to pose as the human Tyler, chief of security for the USS
							Discovery. Tyler’s mind is also altered, so he initially believes he was held as a prisoner
							of war by the Klingons. After returning to the Klingon side for a period, he eventually
							re-joins Starfleet legitimately, as a Section 31 agent. Latif was originally cast in the
							role of Kol. Voq was initially credited as being portrayed by Javid Iqbal, an invented actor
							named for Latif's father, to hide the connection between the characters. Latif described his
							character as "a very complex and painful and deep character", and noted that "there's a
							chemistry, a relationship" with Burnham. Latif's accent for Voq is Arabic-inspired, and he
							tried to maintain "a kind of pharyngealness" to Tyler's American accent.</dd>

					<h3>Story</h3>
					<p>The second season of the American television series Star Trek: Discovery is set roughly a decade
						before the events of the original Star Trek series and follows the crew of the USS Discovery as
						they investigate seven mysterious signals.</p>

					<hr>
					<header>
						<h2><b>Spock</b></h2>
						<h3>Casting : Ethan Peck</h3>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/SP.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<dd>As of his appearances on Discovery, Spock is a Lieutenant, serving under Captain
								Christopher Pike on the Enterprise. Due to the trauma Spock suffered because of his
								visions of the "Red Angel", he is on leave from the Enterprise and under psychiatric
								care. His adopted sister Michael Burnham is attempting to help him recover.</dd>

						<h2><b>Philippa Georgiou</b></h2>
						<h3>Casting : Michelle Yeoh</h3>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/PG.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<dd>Her most Imperial Majesty, Mother of the Fatherland, Regina Andor, Philippa Georgiou
								Augustus Iaponius Centarius was a female Terran who was the Emperor of the Terran Empire
								during the mid-23rd century. The rebellion against her rule appeared to have little
								information about her except that the emperor was ruthless. Her identity was not made
								public, being known as the faceless emperor.</dd>
						</p>
					</header>
					<hr>
					<header>
						<h2><b>Christopher Pike</b></h2>
						<h3>Casting : Anson Mount</h3>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/PI.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<dd>Captain of the Enterprise who temporarily takes command of the Discovery. The character
								was first portrayed by Jeffrey Hunter in the original Star Trek pilot "The Cage". Mount
								described Pike as "very by-the-book, usually, and a good person", while executive
								producers Heather Kadin and Alex Kurtzman described him as being the opposite of Lorca
								with a "very captain-like" presence and "enough confidence and authority to apologize
								when he is wrong".</dd>

					<header>
						<h2><b>Number One</b></h2>
						<h3>Casting : Rebecca Romijn</h3>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/NO.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<dd>Although not shown on-screen, it is implied that Una briefly takes command of the
								Enterprise when Captain Pike and his landing party first beam down to Talos IV. She
								later beams down to the planet several times herself. During "The Cage," Una proves to
								her alien captors that humans would rather die than be slaves. Her official biography
								notes that she is secretly attracted to Pike.</dd>
